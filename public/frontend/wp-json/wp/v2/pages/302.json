Additionally, we wanted to provide travelers to Vietnam a chance to try delicious Vietnamese dishes that most have never been exposed to. On our world famous Saigon food tour, we avoid well known dishes such a Pho, Banh Mi sandwiches, spring rolls, etc. with which Vietnamese food lovers are already familiar, in favor of a myriad of lesser known but remarkably flavorful, local culinary delights. The goal of our tours is to provide a more unique and authentic look into the lives of the local people while offering our guests the safest way to experience the motorbike culture of Vietnam.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At XO Tours all our guides are women, are well versed in English, offer the highest level of customer service, and provide invaluable insight into daily Vietnamese life. When we first started XO Tours women were very underrepresented in the Vietnamese tourism industry but we believed that they could offer an invaluable perspective to life in the country since most of the day to day tasks (running the family business, shopping, cooking, cleaning, child-care, etc.) in a typical Vietnamese household are performed by women.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We call our amazing female staff the \u201cXO Girls\u201d, and they are by far the most important factor in the success of our business! Since 2010, our tours have been featured on ESPN, the Travel Channel, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean Television, and been mentioned in numerous publications all around the world. XO Tours was also voted 1 of the top 9 food tours in the world by Forbes Magazine, one of the 10 best city tours in the world by USA Today, the best food tour in Vietnam by Food &amp; Wine, and one of the top things to do in Ho Chi Minh City by the New York Times!\u00a0 Even with all the acclaim we have received in the past 14 years, we have strived to maintain the authenticity of our tours, so that our guests feel like they are spending time with friends and not going on an organized tour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Join us and find out why over 100,000 travelers have chosen XO Tours to provide them with their best memories in Vietnam!
