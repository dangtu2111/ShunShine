Due to our success, many young women in Vietnam have been provided more opportunities to work in the fast growing tourism industry.\u00a0XO Tours is also the most <a title=\"Read this article\" href=\"http:\/\/xotours.vn\/blog\/2015\/01\/22\/xo-tours-in-hanoi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">copied tour<\/a> in Vietnam with no less than 200 other tour companies mimicking our concept. The main problem with this is that the copycat tours only copy the idea of our tours and not the high standards XO is known for.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the rise in the popularity of motorbike tours in Vietnam, there are many new companies offering cheap tours that may seem like a great bargain but they cut a lot of corners. ALL the cheap tours operate illegally, they serve low quality street food full of carbs to fill you up, they hire students and pay them peanuts which seriously affects the quality and safety of your experience.<strong> The difference between our tours and the cheap copycats is like NIGHT and DAY. It is IMPOSSIBLE to provide the superior tour experience that XO offers at a low price.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1.<\/strong>\u00a0 <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">XO Tours is 100% legal.<\/span> <\/strong>The majority of tour companies in Vietnam operate illegally. All tour operators are required by law to be licensed by VNAT (Vietnam National Administration of Tourism), and have tour guides with international tour guide licenses. Over 90% of the tour operators in Vietnam are not licensed however, because it is much more expensive to operate legally; legal tour operators must have an office, pay taxes, and provide insurance for both staff and customers.<strong> If the tour company that you book with is unlicensed and\/or guided by students, most travel insurance policies will not cover you if you get injured in an accident. Read this blog post to learn how to verify if your tour operator is licensed and legal: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/xotours.vn\/blog\/things-you-should-know-before-booking-a-tour-in-vietnam\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/xotours.vn\/blog\/things-you-should-know-before-booking-a-tour-in-vietnam\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>2.<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> We provide accident insurance<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>and hire support and security staff to ensure your safety.<\/strong> <\/span>The majority cheap tour operators do not provide or will lie about offering accident insurance. Please ask them to provide a copy of their accident insurance policy if you want to be certain. Every guest that books with XO Tours is covered by <span class=\"_4yxo\"><strong>$10,000 USD in NO-FAULT insurance<\/strong>,<\/span> which means that (in case of an accident) we can take you to the best international hospitals or clinics in Vietnam without having to receive preapproval, and there is no risk that you will have to prepay for any medical expenses and then wait to be reimbursed.

In our opinion, great tour guides are borne from professional training and experience. Each of our guides must go through a rigorous interview and training course in order to work for XO Tours. We hire only the best and brightest! Young women who have real passion for their work and love for Vietnam. Our employees only work for XO Tours (no freelance guides!) and are trained to offer the safest possible ride. Because your safety and satisfaction are our paramount concern, we will not compromise on the quality of our staff just to save a few dollars.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4.<\/strong> <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Our tours are exclusive.<\/strong><\/span> Most Vietnam tour operators offer their tours for sale on every single online booking platform (Tripadvisor, Viator, Booking.com, AirBNB Experiences, Get Your Guide, Klook, etc.), through hotels and tour operators, paying tons of commissions for booking referrals.<strong> At XO Tours, the only way to book our tours is through our <a href=\"https:\/\/xotours.vn\">website<\/a> or to contact us directly.<\/strong> We do not want to dilute the quality of our tours by trying to cater to every single type of traveler.<\/p>\n<p>While we are not\u00a0the lowest priced tour, nor the most expensive, \u00a0we\u2019re sure that you won\u2019t find another motorbike tour that offers a better value than XO Tours. We have better drivers, professionally trained tour guides, newer motorbikes, higher quality helmets, a security and support team following every tour, accident insurance and the most caring and fun-loving employees in the world! We may not be the cheapest, but we offer you more for your dollar than any other motorbike tour in Vietnam![\/vc_column_text][\/vc_accordion_tab][vc_accordion_tab title=&#8221;Are there any reasons I shouldn&#8217;t book with XO?&#8221;][vc_column_text]Although we are very proud of the <a href=\"https:\/\/xotours.vn\/press.html\">acclaim our tours have received<\/a>\u00a0over the years, we realize that they are not suitable for everyone. These are the 3\u00a0main\u00a0reasons we think some\u00a0guests\u00a0should<strong> NOT<\/strong>\u00a0book our tours:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. If you are looking for a typical food tour\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All the dishes and stops on the &#8220;XO Foodie&#8221; tour are carefully curated to offer you the most unique experience possible. Unlike other food tours in Vietnam, we are not looking to serve you common Vietnamese dishes that you can find on every street corner, <strong>even if that means taking the risk that you won&#8217;t like every single dish<\/strong>. On the &#8220;XO Foodie Tour&#8221; we want you to eat the exact same dishes that our staff love to eat when they are not working, so those are the types of dishes we offer on the tours. Our goal is to also show you the huge contrast between the different districts so we can give you a feel for what life is truly like for the Saigonese people.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re just looking for a food tour that jumps from one\u00a0food stop to the next however,\u00a0and\u00a0you don\u2019t care to venture outside the touristy\u00a0districts in Saigon\u00a0to see a side of the city that none of the other tours go to, then XO Tours is probably not the tour for you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. If you are not interested in Vietnamese history<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On our<a href=\"\/?page_id=11\"> \u201cSights of Saigon\u201d tour<\/a>, not only will we provide some interesting historical background for each location we take you to, we will also share unique local insights that you won\u2019t find in most guidebooks. Rather than just throwing facts at you, we try to connect each place to a human event, so that you will remember each location for the impact it had on the Vietnamese people. We are proud of our history and we are looking to share it with people that desire more than a skin deep understanding of the places they&#8217;ve seen on tv or read about.\u00a0 If you find history boring however, then you probably shouldn\u2019t book this tour.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3.<\/strong> <strong>If you want the cheapest motorbike tour\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">At XO Tours we want to provide you with a boutique experience that you cannot find anywhere else, combined with the best customer service in Vietnam. We hire the best possible staff and train them to be great ambassadors for\u00a0Vietnam. We believe the time, effort and attention to detail we put into creating our tours\u00a0is reflected in the high quality of the\u00a0tours.<\/p>\n<p>The majority of other motorbike tours operate illegally, serve the cheapest possible food, and hire poorly trained student guides which allows them to run their tours with practically no overhead costs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We believe that majority of travelers are willing to pay a little more for a superior experience and can recognize the value that XO Tours offers. For guests that just want to drive around on a motorbike for the lowest possible price, there are many other options in Saigon to chose from.<\/p>\n<p>If you are like the majority of the 100,000 + guests that have gone on our tours however, we think you will love your time with us![\/vc_column_text][\/vc_accordion_tab][vc_accordion_tab title=&#8221;Do I drive my own motorbike on the tour?&#8221;][vc_column_text]No. All of our guests ride pillion behind one of our driver\/tour guides. Our liability insurance does not permit a guest to drive themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Riding pillion is a great way to relax and to safely see the city. All our female guides are fully licensed and have terrific driving records![\/vc_column_text][\/vc_accordion_tab][vc_accordion_tab title=&#8221;Is it safe to ride a motorbike in Vietnam?&#8221;][vc_column_text]Driving a motorbike in Vietnam is not as dangerous as it looks. The driving speeds in the city are pretty low and most motorbike drivers are very good at avoiding each other.<\/p>\n<p>The most important quality we look for when we hire our employees is driving ability, so all our XO Girls are very safe drivers with excellent driving records.<\/p>\n<p>Click on the video link below to see some older guests safely enjoying their time on our tours:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/C5aT03yvw05\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/C5aT03yvw05\/<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_accordion_tab][vc_accordion_tab title=&#8221;Do you offer a car option if I don&#8217;t want to go by motorbike?&#8221;][vc_column_text]Yes, we offer a car\/bus option if you book a private tour (minimum of 2 adults).\u00a0 There is a $60 USD surcharge to book a car for 2-4 people and an additional $5 USD per person for groups over 4 people ($60 for 4 pax, $65 for 5 pax, $70 for 6 pax, etc.). The surcharge is to cover the cost of the car\/bus rental (with driver). Please keep in mind that the car\/bus option is only available for private tours, and we cannot mix different transport methods (car + motorbikes), so everyone in the same group will have to use the same transport option. We also require at least 24 hours notice if you wish to join one of our tours by car\/bus.<\/p>\n<p>We do not offer a car\/bus option for the group tours since traveling by car\/bus is much slower than by motorbike and out of consideration for our other guests we cannot delay the tour for any single party.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_accordion_tab][vc_accordion_tab title=&#8221;Can you accommodate Vegans and Vegetarians on your tours?&#8221;][vc_column_text]Absolutely!

We can also deal with gluten allergies, nut allergies, shellfish allergies, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Please let us know about your food restrictions, at the time you book your tour, so that we can prepare alternative options.<\/p>\n<p>If you are allergic to fish however, we do not recommend booking our food tour as most dishes in Vietnam are marinated with generous amounts of fish sauce. If you&#8217;re allergic to fish sauce then the only safe dishes for you to eat are the vegetarian dishes.<\/p>\n<p>We also don&#8217;t recommend booking a tour if you are allergic to MSG, as most Vietnamese dishes will contain MSG (including vegetarian dishes).<\/p>\n<p>Click on the video link below to see how XO ensures guests with food allergies don&#8217;t get sick on our tours!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/C7V6FPcPp64\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/C7V6FPcPp64\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>For more information about navigating Vietnam with food allergies (such as gluten sensitivity), please <a href=\"https:\/\/xotours.vn\/blog\/eating-gluten-free-and-other-food-allergies-in-vietnam\/\">read our article<\/a> on the topic.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_accordion_tab][vc_accordion_tab title=&#8221;Are your tours kid friendly?&#8221;][vc_column_text]Yes!

It is very difficult to exchange bills in Vietnam unless they are in near perfect condition.<\/p>\n<p>Currently we use the conversion rate of 1 US Dollar = 25,200 Vietnamese Dong, which is lower than the official rate, and makes it less expensive for our guests to pay in Vietnamese Dong.
